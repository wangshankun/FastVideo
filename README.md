FastVideo currently offers: (with more to come)

- FastHunyuan and FastMochi: consistency distilled video diffusion models for 8x inference speedup.
- First open distillation recipes for video DiT, based on [PCM](https://github.com/G-U-N/Phased-Consistency-Model).
- Support distilling/finetuning/inferencing state-of-the-art open video DiTs: 1. Mochi 2. Hunyuan.
- Scalable training with FSDP, sequence parallelism, and selective activation checkpointing, with near linear scaling to 64 GPUs.
- Memory efficient finetuning with LoRA, precomputed latent, and precomputed text embeddings.

Dev in progress and highly experimental.
## Change Log

- ```2024/12/17```: `FastVideo` v0.1 is released.


## 🔧 Installation
The code is tested on Python 3.10.0, CUDA 12.1 and H100.
```
./env_setup.sh fastvideo
```

## 🚀 Inference
We recommend using a GPU with 80GB of memory. To run the inference, use the following command:

### FastMochi

```bash
# Download the model weight
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/FastMochi-diffusers --local_dir=data/FastMochi-diffusers --repo_type=model
# CLI inference
bash scripts/inference/inference_mochi_sp.sh
```

### FastHunyuan
```bash
# Download the model weight
python scripts/huggingface/download_hf.py --repo_id=FastVideo/FastHunyuan --local_dir=data/FastHunyuan --repo_type=model
# CLI inference
sh scripts/inference/inference_hunyuan.sh
```
You can also inference FastHunyuan in the [official Hunyuan github](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo).
